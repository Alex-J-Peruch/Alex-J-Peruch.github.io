<h2>Why was this site made?</h2>
</body>
<p>I am currently learning how to create websites in this course. Which is really exciting to learn about. But can also be really challenging and or agravating at times as well. To be honest I is sometimes the material, but more so due to my bad habits making things worse. I just hope things go will. I really don't want this website to explode the internet and or the readers computer.</p>
