<h2>Resume 1</h2>
</body>
<p>My experiance with coding and or web design in general is when I took a class on the fundementals of technology on two separete occasions. Aside from the occasional typing lessons, that is all the experiance I have when it comes to computes. It wasn't much but it was honest work.

<h2>Resume 2 </h2>
<P>Some other work that I would consider job experiance for a Resume would be the occasional job with my father's construction company. I help out with production at my church. And I was in band playing the saxophone for 7 years.</P>
